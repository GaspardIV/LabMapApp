# LabMapApp

Application that shows current the usage of computers in MIM UW laboratories. It shows how many computers are free/occupied in each lab.

It allows students to find a perfect spot for individual studying in between classes or an active machine to use as a remote host when working from home.

It utilizes awesome [labmap](https://github.com/tomasz-miskow/labmap) api hosted by @tomasz-miskow rocket.
